### Mobile application for service registration at a beauty salon.
The application has integration with instagram for simple user authorization. Integration with admin instagram for new photo display. Integration with Google Calendar to create events in admins calendar upon user service bookings.
### Installation:
  > npm install
  > cd ios
  > pods install
  > cd ../ && react-native run-ios

Due to the bug in react-native version the IOS simulator must be run from Xcode file (`balisard.xcworkspace`) in ios folder.
